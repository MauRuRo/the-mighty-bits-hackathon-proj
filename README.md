The player needs to choose one answer from the given multiple choice. If the answer is right, the user will get  a score added in the score bar.
If the answer is incorrect, the user won't be able to change the answer and there won't be any points added.

Once the player has gotten the answer, press Next to continue to the following question.
At the end of the game, all the correct answers will be added and the player will get the results.
